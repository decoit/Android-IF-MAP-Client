3 - Setup/Installation:
-----------------------

a) installation
In order to install the Android Client, just use the .apk file that comes with
this package. Information about how to install apk files on your device can
be found here: http://www.brighthub.com/mobile/google-android/articles/37151.aspx  
If you need to uninstall/reinstall, this could also be interesting:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5608540/android-uninstall-failed-adb-uninstall

b) configuring
Before you can use the AndroidIfMapClient, you have to set some Preferences. This
can be done inside the Preferences-Tab. The different Options are explained there.

c) running
Currently, the AndroidIfMapClient can run in 2 different modes: Manual-Update or Auto-Update-Mode.
You can switch between both modes by enabling/disabling "Enable auto-update" inside the 
Preferences-Tab. In Manual Mode, you can publish Device-Characteristics by using the related
Button inside the Main-Tab. In Auto-Update-Mode, this button will be disabled and the 
AndroidIfMapClient will send this data automatically in the Intervall set inside the
Preference-Tab.


4 - TODOs:
----------
   
-> VPN is supported, but the Connection has to be established with the Android
   "Native"-VPN-Client. You can do that by bringing the AndroidIfMapClient to the
   background, connect to VPN via native Android-VPN-Client and reopen the 
   AndroidIfMapClient afterwards. If you look under "Status"-Tab, you should see 
   the new assigned IP from the established VPN-Connection. In future versions, 
   an integrated VPN-Menu may be implemented
